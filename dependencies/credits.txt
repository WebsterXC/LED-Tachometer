CAN BUS COMMUNICATION: Toni Klopfenstein @ SparkFun Electronics.
--The CAN Bus shield was purchased from SparkFun.com and it's their in-house
model. The Canbus class as well as the MCP2551 controller logic files came from
their library on github. They supply a couple of examples as well. These files
handle most of the communication between the vehicle's CAN bus and my Arduino.

SDControl: Relies on two Arduino-supplied libraries, SD and SPI. These files
are included for reference.
